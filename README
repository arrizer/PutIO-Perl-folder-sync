PutIO folder sync
-----------------

This handy perl script helps you downloading whole folders from the Put.io webservice on a regular basis. Just set up folders from your Account and a local path and the script will keep stuff in snyc for you (very useful for fetching stuff thats automatically downloaded to put.io via e.g. torrent RSS feeds).

INSTALLATION
============

The script requires the following perl modules to be installed:

WebService::PutIo::Files 
Getopt::Long
Data::Dumper
LWP::UserAgent
XML::Simple

Use 'install_perl_modules.sh' to install/update the modules via the cpan tool

SETUP
=====

Rename config.xml.template to config.xml and enter your API-Key and secret (found in put.io -> Your Account -> Settings) and your put.io username and password (required for https secured downloads).

For each folder you want to sync, add a block like this:

  <sync>
    <remote_path>TV Shows</remote_path>
    <local_path>/AnkhMorpork/Series/Inbox</local_path>
  </sync>

to the config.xml (inside <putiosyncconfig>).

See the config file template for details about the configuration.

RUN
===

To run the script, simply use

$ perl putiosync.pl

from the command line.
Use the -h flag to see all available options.
I recommend to schedule the script via cronjob, launchd or your native system task scheduler.
