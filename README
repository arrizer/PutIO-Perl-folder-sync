PutIO folder sync
-----------------

This handy perl script helps you downloading whole folders from the Put.io webservice on a regular basis. Just set up folders from your Account and a local path and the script will keep stuff in snyc for you (very useful for fetching stuff thats automatically downloaded to put.io via e.g. torrent RSS feeds).

INSTALLATION
============

Make sure you have installed the following perl modules via cpan:

WebService::PutIo::Files 
Getopt::Long
Data::Dumper
LWP::UserAgent
XML::Simple

ATTENTION: The Put.io CPAN module is currently outdated becaus it depends on a depcreated class from Mojolocious. I have fixed this in in the file 'PutIo.pm' so you need to overwrite the current PutIo.pm file in your perl libs directory after installing put.io via cpan!

SETUP
=====

Rename config.xml.template to config.xml and enter your API-Key and secret (found in put.io -> Your Account -> Settings) and your put.io username and password (required for https secured downloads).

For each folder you want to sync, add a block like this:

  <sync>
    <remote_path>TV Shows</remote_path>
    <local_path>/AnkhMorpork/Series/Inbox</local_path>
  </sync>

to the config.xml (inside <putiosyncconfig>).

Make sure that remote folders don't start with a / but local ones are!

RUN
===

To run the script, simply use

$ perl putiosync.pl

from the command line. Have fun!
